## ***Who We Are***

The Mahwah Robo T-Birds is a team of bright, driven Mahwah High School students that compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition—a worldwide tournament in which high schools from around the world conceive and build their own robot to compete/cooperate in a yearly game. In these competitions, students are tasked with designing, building, testing, and improving a robot in six weeks with minimal help from adults, placing them into a near-perfect simulation of the real-world engineering process. In just the past few years, they have built robots that can shoot balls into different-sized hoops, traverse through different types of obstacles, lift themselves up from the ground, and more.

## ***Why You Should Care***

Not only is the Robo T-Birds a celebrated tradition among Mahwah High School students and alumni (running since 2005), but it allows students to work in a real-world engineering environment, hone their skills, work together, and have fun in the process. The team provides a valuable, truly beneficial experience to students that cannot be found anywhere else, nurturing the next generation of Mahwah engineers.

While the benefits of this program on Mahwah’s students are immeasurable, this experience comes at no small expense. In order to purchase robot parts, compete in regional tournaments, and hopefully go to the Championship, the team needs around $15,000 each year. Thanks to the Mahwah Board of Education and other contributors, the Robo T-Birds are on their way to reaching that goal—but to give these students the experience they truly deserve and ensure success in the new competition, we need support from sponsors like you.

The Mahwah Robo-T-Birds are a team of bright, driven Mahwah High School students that compete in the FIRST Robotics Competitionâ€”a worldwide tournament in which high schools from around the world conceive and build their own robot to compete/cooperate in a yearly game. 

## History

The team was founded in 2005 and has competed in every season since then. In 2022, the Robo-T-Birds got to semifinals in both district events and qualified for district championships!

The Mahwah Robo T-Birds is a team of bright, driven Mahwah High School students that compete in the FIRST Robotics Competitionâ€”a worldwide tournament in which high schools from around the world conceive and build their own robot to compete/cooperate in a yearly game. In these competitions, students are tasked with designing, building, testing, and improving a robot in six weeks with minimal help from adults, placing them into a near-perfect simulation of the real-world engineering process. In just the past few years, they have built robots that can shoot balls into different-sized hoops, traverse through different types of obstacles, lift themselves up from the ground, and more.
